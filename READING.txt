 * New texture lookup functions are provided that allow shaders to
   access individual texels using integer coordinates referring to the
   texel location and level of detail. No filtering is
   performed. These functions allow applications to use textures as
   one-, two-, and three-dimensional arrays.

 * Full signed integer and unsigned integer support in the OpenGL
   Shading Language

   - Fragment shaders can define their own output variables, and
     declare them to be of type floating-point, integer or unsigned
     integer. These variables are bound to a fragment color index with
     the new API command BindFragDataLocationEXT(), and directed to
     buffers using the existing DrawBuffer or DrawBuffers API
     commands.
